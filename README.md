# Python_ML_Salifort_Motors_Employee_Retention_Project

## Overview
A project overview should be a few sentences long stating the problem you solved, what data was used in the project, 
and your modeling results.

## Business Understanding
You should have a section that showcases the stakeholder(s) and the business problem you tried to solve. 
Feel free to add citations of research you did on your business problem here as well. 

Salifort Motors is a fictional French-based alternative energy vehicle manufacturer.
They have received the results of a recent employee survey. The senior leadership team has wants to analize the data 
to come up with ideas for how to increase employee retention. 
They would like to design a model that predicts whether an employee will leave the company based on their  
department, number of projects, average monthly hours, and any other data points you deem helpful.

## Data Understanding
Explain what data you used in your analysis, the timeframe of the data, and any data limitations. 
This is also a good section to add visualizations of your exploratory data analysis. 


## Modeling Evaluation
This section should detail what models you used and the corresponding evaluation metrics. 



## Conclusion
In the conclusion section explain the recommendations you have in solving the business problem and highlight any 
future steps you will take to expand on your project.

- Control and limit the number of projects that an employee can work on simultaneously.
- Conduct further investigations about why 4 year tenure employees are so dissatisfied.
- Reward employees that work long hours and give them some kind of recognition (promotion, salary, bonuses, company awards).
- Create  culture, incentives and polocies of healthier work/life balance.
- High evaluation scores shouldn´t be reserved only for eployees who work long hours.

#### Next Steps
- Adress and do further verifications for data leakage.
- Consider how predictions change when last_evaluation is removed from the data. It´s possible that evaluations aren´t performed frequently.
It colud be useful to predict retention whithout this feature.
- There could further analysis building K-means model and analyzing the clusters, this may give valuable insights.
